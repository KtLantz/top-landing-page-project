# top-landing-page-project

A landing page project that needs to be submitted to the Odin Project. 

Future lessons/Things to improve:  

- I had to update most of the code from the first iteration to make it more succinct - I imagine there is a better way to organize the classes and elements used, but that is a skill that will take more time and practice. 

- While certain items flex, in a smaller view port/browser the elements are not well organized, creating a disorganized, unpleasant experience for the user: knowing there is a way to change the CSS for different views (mobile, tablet, etc.), I need to brush up my knowledge on that part of CSS.
