# top-landing-page-project

A landing page project that needs to be submitted to the Odin Project. 

As of 11/21, the following items need to be changed/updated: 

- adding actual text to the page, instead of dummy text. 
- adding a photo that will fit the actual content. 
- a logo, probably will create something in canva. 
- replacing the text of "link 1, 2, 3" to something else. 
- removing the space between the subheader text and the header in the following areas: 
     - Hero section (underneath the main title).
     - underneath the individual boxes in the card section.
     - underneath the call to action title in the cta section.
-adding a flex shrink or something comparable to keep boxes from overlapping when the browser window shrinks. 
-updating dummy text in the footer. 

*overall, just cleaning up unnecessary css elements to make the sheet more succinct.
